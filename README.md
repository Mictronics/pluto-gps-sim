# PLUTO-GPS-SIM

PLUTO-GPS-SIM generates a GPS baseband signal IQ data stream, which is then transmitted by the
software-defined radio (SDR) platform [ADALM-Pluto](https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto).

Project based on [gps-sdr-sim](https://github.com/osqzss/gps-sdr-sim). Kudos to Takuji Ebinuma.

[Windows 32-bit version](https://github.com/Mictronics/pluto-gps-sim-win32)

### Generating the GPS signal
The user is able to assign a static location directly through the command line.

The user also specifies the GPS satellite constellation through a GPS broadcast
ephemeris file. The daily GPS broadcast ephemeris file (brdc) is a merge of the
individual site navigation files into one. The archive for the daily file is:

[ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gnss/data/daily/](ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gnss/data/daily/)

These files are then used to generate the simulated pseudorange and
Doppler for the GPS satellites in view. This simulated range data is
then used to generate the digitized I/Q samples for the GPS signal
which are then feed into ADALM-Pluto SDR to transmit the GPS L1 frequency.

The simulation start time can be specified if the corresponding set of ephemerides
is available. Otherwise the first time of ephemeris in the RINEX navigation file
is selected.

### Build instructions
#### Dependencies

Build depends on libm, libpthread and libcurl4-openssl-dev.

You will also need the latest build and install of libad9361-dev and libiio-dev. The Debian packages
libad9361-dev that is available up to Debian 9 (stretch) is outdated and missing a required function.
So you have to build packages from source:

The first step is to fetch the dependencies, which as of now is only libxml2. On a Debian-flavoured GNU/Linux distribution, like Ubuntu for instance:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev bison flex libcdk5-dev cmake
```
Depending on the backend (how you want to attach the IIO device), you may need at least one of:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libaio-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libserialport-dev libxml2-dev libavahi-client-dev doxygen graphviz
```
Then build in this order:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio.git
$ cd libiio
$ cmake ./
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libad9361-iio.git
$ cd libad9361-iio
$ cmake ./
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

#### Building under Linux with GCC
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mictronics/pluto-gps-sim
$ cd pluto-gps-sim
$ make all
```

```

Pull actual RINEX navigation file from NASA FTP server
```
./pluto-gps-sim -f -e brdc.n -l 30.286502,120.032669,100
```

Set user motion mode:
```
> pluto-gps-sim -e brdc3540.14n -u circle.csv
```

Set static mode location:

```
> pluto-gps-sim -e brdc3540.14n -l 30.286502,120.032669,100
```

Set TX attenuation:
```
> pluto-gps-sim -e brdc3540.14n -A -30.0
```
Default -20.0dB. Applicable range 0.0dB to -80.0dB in 0.25dB steps.

Set RF bandwidth:
```
> pluto-gps-sim -e brdc3540.14n -B 3.0
```
Default 3.0MHz. Applicable range 1.0MHz to 5.0MHz

### Transmitting the samples

The TX port of a particular SDR platform is connected to the GPS receiver
under test through a DC block and a fixed 50-60dB attenuator.
